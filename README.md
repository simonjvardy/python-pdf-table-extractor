# Python - PDF Table Extractor App #

## About ##

This small utility app was created to help with the tedious task of extracting data contained in tables of vendor PDF product data sheets.

[Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) has been used previously and is highly recommended, but I needed something that I could customise to my needs a little more.
